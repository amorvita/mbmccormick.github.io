This is a [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)-powered blog hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for [mbmccormick.com](http://mbmccormick.com). Feel free to browse the source, fork this repository, or [ask me questions](http://twitter.com/mbmccormick). You can read about my transition from WordPress to Jekyll [here](http://mbmccormick.com/2011/10/ditching-wordpress-for-jekyll-and-github/).

## Website Design

Credit for the original design and inspiration of this goes to [Kyle Neath](http://warpspire.com). While many of his design elements are still in use in my website's current design, I have made the following changes to his code:

* Upgraded website layout to HTML5
* Added responsive stylesheet for tablets and smartphones
* Implemented Jekyll pagination
* Added Google search functionality

I've also added some more GitHub-style colors and icons to the design. All of the code for this version is now W3C valid and follows all HTML5 standards.
