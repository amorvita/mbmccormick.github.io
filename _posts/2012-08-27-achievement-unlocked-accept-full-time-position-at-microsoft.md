Just before my internship at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx) ended this summer, they extended me a full-time job offer. I accepted their offer on the spot. This was literally a dream come true for me. I will be returning to Microsoft early next year with [Microsoft Lync][2] Server, helping to create new innovations in how people communicate and collaborate. This is an extremely [exciting time for Microsoft][3] as a company and Lync is no exception.

Looking back at how I got to this point, I am thankful for the people that I have met and who inspired me and happy with the choices that I made for my education and professional life. For the first two years at [Purdue University][4], I was studying Mechanical Engineering. After a month in the program, I was working away in my dorm room for a company that hired me to write software that flashed a new operating system onto an innovative mobile email device. That was probably the first sign that I was studying the wrong thing. I ignored this and continued on.

At some point, I decided it was time to change my major to something that interested me. Something that I could do, and be happy doing, for free. Something that I had been doing for years, ignoring the signs all along. Lucky for me, Purdue is home of the [oldest computer science program][5] in the nation. Before my official change of major paperwork was processed and before I had any formal training in computer science, I met with a recruiter (who I am now good friends with) at Microsoft. Against his better judgement, I convinced him to give me a shot at the interview process. The rest is pretty much history.

I've used [this quote][6] in a [blog post][7] before in a different setting, but here it is again:

> I joined this company before I was legally allowed to drink – it's the only company I've ever worked for. At a time when I wasn't sure what to do with my life, Microsoft gave me a place where I belonged, where I fit in. I've got to do some amazing things here. I got to build developer tools used by millions, consumer websites, super scalable infrastructure stuff and design APIs called a gazillion times a day. I got to travel the world and work with execs from the biggest companies in the world. I got to fulfill a childhood dream and write a book. I got interviewed in the NYTimes. I've done some crazy things and I got to meet and hang out with my heroes. I even wound up marrying an amazing woman who joined Microsoft with me.

I am thankful for the opportunity that Microsoft has given me and I am excited about my future at this company. I am fortunate enough to have built a career out of my passion. I am even more fortunate for my family, friends, and mentors that I have had over the years who helped get me to where I am today. OK enough sappy reflection on the past, here's to the future.
