<em>Update: Mojito has been updated with support for budgets, notifications, and displaying net worth balance on a live tile. The screenshots below and the XAP file have all been updated to reflect these changes.</em>

Last night I had a lot of motivation to write a new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Phone</a> application in an effort to reduce the jet lag from my long flight home. I decided to write an unofficial app for <a href="https://www.mint.com/" target="_blank">Mint.com</a>. Although Mint.com does not have a public API available for developers to use, I was able to get access to some basic data such as account names, balances, last updated time, and some other details. Mojito, as I'm calling it, currently allows you to login and view your account names, balances, and last updated time. Additional features are being added, but details on those will come over the next couple of weeks. Take a look at the screenshots below:

I'm sure you're wondering, but no, those are not the actual balances of my bank accounts. I wish my bank accounts had that many numbers in them. But this should give you an idea of what Mojito is capable of and what to expect from it moving forward. You can download the <a href="http://forums.asp.net/t/1277554.aspx" target="_blank">XAP file</a> for this very early build of <a href="http://mbmccormick.com/files/Mojito.xap" target="_blank">Mojito here</a>, be advised you will need a <a href="http://cisforcoder.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/unlocking-your-wp7-device-for-app-development/" target="_blank">developer unlocked</a> phone running <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/27/windows-phone-7-5-mango-in-depth-preview-video/" target="_blank">Mango</a> to install this application.
