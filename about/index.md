title: About
---

My name is Matt McCormick and I am a senior at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu) studying computer science, with a concentration in software engineering. I have a passion for technology, which drives my interest for software development and website design. I started my business, [McCormick Technologies](http://www.mccormicktechnologies.com), in January of 2009 as an entity through which to conduct my freelance work. More information about my clients and the services that I offer can be found on my business website.

This past summer I worked at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) in Redmond, WA in Microsoft Lync as a Program Manager Intern in the server platform team. I will be returning to Microsoft in the same role and for the same team next summer. I am also the Microsoft Ambassador for Purdue University.

You can take a look at some of the projects that I am working on at my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/mbmccormick) page.
