# About

My name is Matt McCormick and I am a senior at Purdue University studying computer science, with a concentration in software engineering. I have a passion for technology, which drives my interest for software development and website design. I started my business, McCormick Technologies, in January of 2009 as an entity through which to conduct my freelance work. More information about my clients and the services that I offer can be found on my business website.

This summer I am working at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington on the Microsoft Lync team as a Program Manager Intern in the server platform. I am really excited about this opportunity and I already love Seattle in the summer!
