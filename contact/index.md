Feel free to contact me at any time, but please consult my [calendar](http://mbmccormick.com/calendar) before doing so, as I have a lot going on with school, my job, and my business. I can be reached by email or phone and I’d be more than happy to answer any questions that you might have.

Please note that I am not accepting any work for the summer. I will resume my freelance work in the fall.
